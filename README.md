# What is this for?
I use this as a playground for experimenting latest Android technologies. Currently it has 2 simple screens - flag list and flag details with offline data support.

Libraries/Techniques:

* Navigation Component with a single Activity
* Architecture Components with MVVM
* Material Components
* Kotlin Coroutine, Flow and FlowBinding
* Room

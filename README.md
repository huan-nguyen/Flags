# What is this for?
To showcase an Android app architecture based on Coroutine and Architecture Component. 
Also include the demo of various Android framework/Kotlin features:

* Navigation Component
* Material Components
* Basic shared element transition between screens
* Reactive View state management following Jake Wharton's [recommended approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IKHxjkgop4)
* MockRetrofit
* Also a bit of simple service locator/dependency injection pattern of managing dependencies for small projects where Dagger or other DI frameworks might be overkill
